## BLI225
## COMMUNICATION SKILLS

### Term-End Examination June, 2022
**1. Read the following passage and answer in your own words the questions that follow :**

Romain Rolland (1866-1944) endeavours, very early, to maintain contact between genuine France and genuine Germany and to dampen the climate of violence and folly that he sees on both sides. Even though he might pass for an anti-patriot, he refuses to be led by nationalistic passions. Furthermore, he denounces the evils of war, shouting his horror for all the destruction it provokes. 

His pacifist attitude appears in several literary works. Liluli (1919), Pierre et Luce (1919), Clerambault (1920)—all three emphasize his horror for violence and they attack the absurdity of war which blindly massacres men, sparing none, and which represents absolute evil.

The third work is the most important, in as much as it is there that Rolland analyzes his pacifism. He depicts a character who, after having let himself be submerged by the passions of the crowd, manages to extricate and free himself from all arguments used to justify war.

This pacifism, inspired by Tolstoy’s philosophy, has religious essence. [It] represents the theoretical attitude of a ‘free mind’, no concrete or pragmatic dimension can be found in it.
According to some, this doctrine, although noble cannot be applied. In 1922, Henri Barbusse (1873-1935), the French novelist and member of the French Communist Party, challenged ‘rollandism’ which, even if it exalts individual freedom, remains an unscientific and inefficient theory when compared to Marxism.

Rolland opposed to Barbusse the non-violence of Gandhi; he saw in it an alternative to revolutionary violence. Pursuing the thinking developed in Clerambault, he brought out the religious aspect of Gandhi’s doctrine. The biography that he wrote was a hagiography which depicted a modern-day Christ.

**Questions :**
- (a) Who was Romain Rolland ? **3**
- (b) Why according to the author of the passage is Clerambault an important work ? **3**
- (c) Who was Pierre et Luce ? **3**
- (d) What did Barbusse think of Rolland’s ideas ?**3**
- (e) What were Rolland’s attitude towards Gandhiji ? **3**

### Term-End Examination December, 2021

**1. Read the passage and answer the questions that follow :**

You may have a personal portfolio website for a number of reasons. If you’re a freelancer, then you’d need one to showcase your work and allow people to contact you. If you’re a student (or unemployed), then you’d need one to show prospective employers how good you are and what you can do, so that they might hire you. If you’re part of a studio, then you might use one to blog about your design life, show people what you’re doing and build your online presence.

A personal portfolio website is all about promoting you. You are a brand, and your name is a brand name. No one is going to know about your brand unless you get it out there; and if you’re a Web designer, developer, writer, gamer or any other type of creative, then it’s essential that you have a good portfolio website.

Your logo is usually the first thing a user sees. It doesn’t necessarily have to be your name, but if you’re trying to promote yourself online, then it’s a good idea to go by your name. And always link your logo to your home page. It’s a common convention that users expect online. 

Once the user sees who owns the website, they’ll want to know what it is you do. This is where you explain what you do with a tagline. Your tagline should be short and snappy,
summarizing what you do.

This is a personal portfolio website after all, so your portfolio will determine whether the website is interesting or not. People will want to see your previous work to decide whether you’re good or not and for general interest, to see what you’ve been up to in the past.

Depending on what you do, your portfolio should contain big high-quality images, clearly accessible to the user. Include a short description for each project, including the different skills that you needed to complete the project.

Make it clear, and break it down: Web design, development, video, copywriting, branding, etc. You may want to be even more specific: corporate branding, church website design, Flash banner ads and so on.

It’s all about you. Let people see the man or woman behind the mask (i.e., website). Share your background, where you came from, how many years you’ve been in the business, etc. The more details you give, the better your users can form a bond and build trust with you.

If you’re not camera-shy, show a picture of yourself. This will give potential clients peace of mind by allowing them to see who they’re dealing with, and it adds an element of trust.

**(a) Answer the questions that follow : 6X2=12**

- (i) What does a personal portfolio website mean?
- (ii) Why do we include a photograph in the portfolio?
- (iii) What do people expect while accessing attire in a portfolio?

**2. Write short notes on any two of the following : 2X5=10**

**5. Presentations are a very important form of communication. What are the attributes of a good presentation ? Explain the use of various visual aids in presentations. 10**

- (a) Public library is ________ important place for study and leisure.

### Term-End Examination June, 2021

**1. Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow:**

Good manners reveal what kind of a person one is. One who expresses good manners in word and deed is appreciated. Such a person earns the love, admiration and respect of others. Good
mannered persons give those whom they interact with their due dignity and respect. People like to have friendship with good mannered persons. You can show good manners through what you say and how you say it. Using foul language and abusive words while talking is bad manner. It is also bad manners to use derogatory words. There are always better words that can be used to say the same thing. Referring to a person as old is not polite. Instead they can be referred to as being elderly.

Being polite is good manners. Speaking rudely and arrogantly is bad manners. Interrupting a person who is speaking is also bad manners. It is good manners to wait for one’s chance to speak. Being impolite and rude while talking shows one does not give the other person their due dignity and respect. Saying thank you, sorry, welcome and pardon as may be required and at the appropriate time while speaking or at any other time is good manners.

If you show courtesy to another it is good manners. Offering one’s seat to an elderly person, a woman or a physically challenged person whether on a bus or at an office reflects good manners. Similarly, giving preference to the elderly or sick in a queue is good manners. Being chivalrous is also good manners. Allowing the elderly, women and children to pass through an open door or board a bus is good manners. Being good mannered even at the cost of one’s convenience shows the honesty behind one’s good manners. If one is truly good mannered it is appreciated by the recipient of a favour or good deed.

Good manners should be inculcated right in childhood. The good behaviour and conduct ingrained in us from childhood seldom leave us. The traits that make up good manners help us through life. Good manners spread good cheer. One should be good mannered at all times. That shows integrity of character. If one is good mannered only where there is some benefit to be accrued or to give a good impression of oneself to others, it means the good manners are not truly a part of the person. It shows the superficiality of the good manners expressed.

**a)**

- (i) How does good mannered people treat others? 2
- (ii) What should we avoid while speaking to people? 2
- (iii) How do people with bad manners treat others? 2
- (iv) What are the best ways to show courtesy to others? 2
- (v) Suggest a suitable title for the above passage. 2

**(b) Make sentences with the following in your own words in a way that their meaning gets clear : 5×1=5**

- (i) Courtesy
- (ii) Rude
